# THE CORTEX CHRONICLES, CHAPTER 3 - The Escape of Rowan Reed

Developed for the Game Creator's Club at Lusofona University.
This month, the theme was "Pixel Inspiration": choose one or more submissions from the [GB Pixel Art Jam 2023] and be inspired by it.

I was inspired by all of them, and decided to learn [GB Studio] and make a game in it.

This is a part of what I hope will be "The Cortex Chronicles" - I want all the games I do for the Game Creator's Club this year to be linked together, hence this idea.
I also want to use a different engine on every entry, so let's see how that goes! :)

In this game, we take control of Rowan Reed, the main character from Cortex Chronicles 1.
After being arrested in a prison, he has to navigate it and find a way to escape.
